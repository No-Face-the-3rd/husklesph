# prophunters

This is a fork of MechanicalMind's Prop Hunters, intended to fix a few bugs and add a few features.

## Differences

- On death, taunts no longer persist into spectator mode.
- The taunt menu remembers your mouse position when reopened.
- The taunt menu phrase is customizable. For example: `ph_taunt_menu_phrase "annoy the hunters"`
- Taunt loader logging prints the full path to the loaded file, not just the filename itself.
